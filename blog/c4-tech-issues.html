  <h2>Issues in the Tech World</h2>

      In today's blogpost I am going to discuss a problem in the tech world that interests me. One of the biggest challenges facing the tech industry is how the growth in demand for content greatly exceeds the current bandwidth supply. This is particularly true for rich media like video streaming. According to a Sandvine study for the first half of 2014, Netflix and YouTube services alone accounted for almost half of all data usage: <br><img class="normalimage" src="DataUsageStats.png">

      Streaming a video or audio file consists of viewing or consuming a file as it is downloaded, rather than while it is being downloaded. Streaming a file also allows the viewer to keep free space rather than keep the file on a local device. The restriction on the speed at which a file is streamed has to do with our own internet connection and availability.  

      discuss what is bandwidth and how does it exist
      Discuss whether there is a finite amount of bandwidth in the world

      discuss how rich media file sizes are larger than text content files
      discuss what is streaming and how we are consuming rich media content

    </p>
    <p>
      discuss how to improve the hardware to produce more bandwidth
      discuss what is compression 
      discuss the trade off between fidelity and compression 


      The solutions for this issue revolve primarily around two different points of throttle, as you may guess, improving hardware and software. Improving hardware means improving the physical cables that transmit data from content sources to our devices. Improving software means reducing the file size that is transmitted without reducing the quality of the file, this is known as compression.

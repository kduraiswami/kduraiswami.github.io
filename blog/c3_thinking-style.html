  <h1>Unit 1, Week 3 Cultural Blogpost</h1>
  <h2>Thinking Styles</h2>
  <h4>Sunday January 11, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      In today's blogpost I am going to investigate my thinking style in the Gregorc Thinking Style paradigm, how it fits into DBC and what I can do to broaden my approach to challenges. My thinking style is Abstract Sequential. People in this learning style like to be heard and analyze situations carefully before pursuing an action. The Abstract Sequential (AS) style does best with access to learning resources and are able to learn alone. AS thinkers struggle to work with those with different view points and in situations with specific rules and regulations and time constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I read these descriptions of my thinking style it sounds like bad news for how I fit into DBC. DBC does have a lot of specified rules and ways to learn and there is a significant time constraint on how we learn. I would also say so far I have spent more time learning on my own, successfully using online resources and our text, and I have struggled most with learning from other members of our cohorts. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is only one way of looking at my interaction with DBC. The specific rules for DBC are a necessary function of remote learning on our own. We do not have the opportunity to work closely with instructors or each other yet. We need very specific guidelines and tasks to make sure everyone will be ready when we are actually learning in person at our cohort locations. The short timeframe we have to learn what we need is also a necessary function of DBC. We are entering an intensive course designed ot make us successful junior developers. After we complete our program I believe we are free to take time as we need to become better developers.  
    </p>
    <p>
      As I said above, my greatest challenge with DBC has been working with pairs. I have certainly enjoyed the people i have been able to work with, however I do feel like sometimes there was not much accomplished on my end. I think that part of my challenges with learning with pairing has been a lack of clarity of objectives of my sessions. I think it would be beneficial for me to be cognizant of my challenges as an AS thinker and make sure I have clear objectives with my pair as to what we want to learn together. This will help me learn as much as possible from these sessions.

    <p>
      I think it would also help me grow an appreciation for the skill of working on a team if I could find more examples in the real world of how software teams develop new ideas. This could help me expand my appreciation for working in pairs and also give me a lot more to look for in terms of learning objectives. The opportunity to pair program is worth more than just learning the task or syntax at hand, but also the ability to learn how to work as a team in general. I do feel confident in my ability to communicate so I think this is an objective I can accomplish!

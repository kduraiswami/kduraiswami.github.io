      Pairing: 
      It is sometimes easier and sometimes more difficult for me to pair with others on challenges. I like that we are able to approach a challenge with multiple approaches to see what works best. However, sometimes I feel like I am unable to pursue what I think is best because it is not listening to what my pair would like to do as well. Creating these compormises can be difficult, but perhaps there is a good way to compromise on certain items and create a net positive result for a pair. I did find it rewarding when I was able to ask my pairs about how I code and about whether they liked my syntax and communication abilities. That can only happen through pairing when someone is invested in the outcome of the work.

      I mentioned above I found it rewarding to know what my peers thought about certain aspects of my coding ability and how I interacted with them. This is known as feedback and the most effective type of feedback is called ASK feedback. Our desired type of feedback in this world is Actionable, Kind and Specific. This type of feedback is optimal because it helps an individual learn and grow the most from your obsevations and experiences with them. Feedback is important because although we may learn about our decision making and choices through our personal observations, it is often better to learn from the people that are on the other end of our choices directly.

      Looking at our choices in a raw way, especially in the anonymous way that Dev Bootcamp provides can be challenging. Seeing our peformance reviewed can ceate a sense of vulnerability. Vulnerability is a difficult feeling to experience. I believe one of the most tangible reactions I have to vulnerable situations is the expectation of criticism. I do not think this is a unique approach to dealing with vulnerability. I think I choose to deal with this expectation defensively while some may deal with criticism on touchy subjects more offensively. The important habit to build is to look at feedback and our vulnerable points as opportunities for growth and self improvement, not pain. We need to hear from society and our peers in order to better for ourselves and others.

      In the end I think this is the best way to approach reading our feedback and producing our own feedback for those we work with. The more we say and the more we produce about the way someone worked the better off they will be in the end. Producing feedback for me in the earliest stages of our program was formulaic and I did not have too much to say beyond gut feelings and reactions to pair interactions. Now I see its worth it to point things out while pairing and afterwards to help my pair become more aware of what they are doing. I hope in turn this empowers the people I work with to feel like they should be open and consistent with the feedback they want to give me.

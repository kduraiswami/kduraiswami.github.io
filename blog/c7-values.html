I read in a book once "the Value of Values" by Swami Dayananda Saraswati that values are principles. Values are not feelings, or reactions to experience, in fact values are the attitudes and beliefs we hold prior to an event happening. When I frame the definition of values like this, I want to revise the list above to include only terms which I would actually consider "values." For example "music" might be very important, but my definition does not consider "music" to be a value. My revised list would include:<br><br>

      I try to live up to the values I hold important as much as possible and think about my beliefs before a choice comes up. The more structure we give to our life in general, the more enjoyable and productive our life will be. We can give our values structure by thinking about, challenging and resolving what our values are. Value structures will help us approach the decisions and consequences we experience in life. The more structure we give to our values, the more easily we can deal with decision making of almost any kind.

      Paul Graham wrote in his 2007 essay "How Not to Die" and in his 2009 essay "What Startups are Really Like" the importance of one specific value for startups. He talked both times about how if founders did one thing, they would improve and maximize their chances of success enormously; never give up. For me it is not a difficult question what my most important value is currently; persistence.

      I am new to coding with a lot of dreams, ambitions and high expectations. I currently struggle to implement basic features in applications I build right now. We all feel how difficult it is to experience crawling before walking and walking before running and essentially avoid learning new skills altogether as soon as we can in life. Rather than finding out what we need to learn to seize the world around us and the opportunities in front of us we look in the mirror and ask what that version of ourselves can do best.

      It makes me uncomfortable to admit what I can't do, but I know it would be worse to live with what I didn't do. So while I hope I have a broad value structure, there is only one worth talking about right now. The one that tells me to get up and keep going whether its for an additional inch or mile that day. The one that doesn't get discouraged knowing 1% of what I want to know. The one that says I can't stop until I can build a great product for a userbase. Persistence.

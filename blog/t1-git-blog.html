  <h1>Unit 1, Week 1 Blogpost</h1>
  <h2>Version Control, Git Tracking and GitHub benefits</h2>
  <h4>Sunday December 14, 2014</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
        Welcome to my first blogpost! Today I will investigate some of the basic features of Git and some of the benefits of storing code on GitHub. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the great features of using gits is version control. Version control allows a developer to recall different instances of code he or she is working with. To me this means a developer can look back through time on code or compare different appearances of a project they are working on. Being able to traverse through time has many benefits to a developer. For example it allows someone to check when a certain addition or code change worked and when it may have stopped working. This can help with debugging and improving code as it interacts with the greater project. Version control helps with front end development too. When I was much younger in elementary school I bought an instructional drawing book that taught how to draw xmen and other marvel characters. I still remember the number one piece of advice, "use your eraser." Version control allows a frontend developer to use an eraser without permanently changing the graphic. This is a huge help in exploring new layouts while still giving the access to any template before to start from again. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another great feature of git is tracking file changes. When a file is git tracked it means changes are documented in the file. Git tracked files can be pushed to the remote storage location or be pulled from a remote location as well. Git files that are committed and pushed to a site like GitHub will be stored with notations as to what changes were made. It is up to the developer making the notations to make sure they are descriptive and capture the changes made. Later, anyone with access to the git tracked file can see the different file commits to see what changes were made in each version. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most popular places to store code and gits is right here on GitHub. Storing code remotely has two great benefits, remote storage and remote access. Storing code and files in general at a remote location obviously has a security and failsafe benefits. If a local device if a laptop is lost or physically damaged, storing code at an alternate location allows these files and data to remain accessible. Using GitHub also allows for much easier collaboration on code. Working together is an important way to improve code. Being able to work as a team by adding and viewing different branches as a team is easy using a centralized remote storage system like GitHub.

  <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h4>Thursday February 5, 2015</h4>

  <section>

    <p>
      In our week 6 cultural blog post I want to examine my experiences with stereotype threat and look at how to to address stereotype threat in the most comprehensive way possible. Stereotype threat is the risk of conforming a negative stereotype of a social group someone represents. I am part of a few groups that are immediately clear: young, male, Indian American, new to software development. However I want to inspect another group that isn't immediately clear, a business failure. I have started and legitimately tried in more business ideas than I can remember. I do not view failure with a salty taste, I know that it is a legitimate function for learning. I am very glad I have tried my ideas and I will continue to get better at implementing them. 
    </p>

      The stereotype threat of being a business failure is not what you may expect. The stereotype threat is to be the lone wolf no matter what. The threat is continuing to try on my own even when greater resources and tools exist elsewhere for me to learn. I feel that threat constantly within myself. I feel like I should swim against the current no matter what direction the river flows. I should avoid working at a large company and go for gold on my own ideas and knowledge base. This is hard to deal with and I feel the expectation when I look at many business minds that failed but went on to be ultimately successful.

      I certainly feel this threat within myself. I feel torn between doing what is prescribed and what I discover. I feel challenged to do anything as a mandate, including and especially assignments from DBC. I feel challenged to view any formal source of learning as an opportunity to grow rather than an institution I need to refute. This prevents me from embracing DBC sometimes and doing our assignments on time. I choose to spend my time elsewhere on my own ideas even though many of our challenges in DBC are useful and cultivate important skills.

      A difference between my stereotype threat mentioned above and most of the ones we are familiar with is that being a business failure is a choice I made personally and, especially here in the Valley, it is not viewed as a particularly bad category to be in. More familiar stereotype threats are social pressures placed on our attributes and descriptions we had no control over. Statuses like race, age and gender identification all have stereotype threats and perhaps have their own unique stereotypes in the technology field we are entering.

      If I observe a stereotype threat I will definitely keep it in mind and try to approach the subject with the individual in mind at a later time. I believe the most optimum way to handle someone lowering their expectations of themselves due to stereotype would be to speak with them in private. If I am able to create a safe space and communicate openly with someone, hopefully they would feel comfortable speaking about pressures they feel towards lower expectations they place on themselves. I believe this would best be done in a one on one environment. Hopefully in that space the person would feel empowered to talk about how they feel and where they heard they couldn't do as much because of their stereotype. Hopefully through good conversation and good experience with success, they can start to hold themselves accountable to any standard they want.

      Cultivating an environment that does not cater to stereotype threats is not as easy as it sounds. While active choices like letting everyone know they are valued and letting everyone know they are capable of accomplishing tasks sounds nice, it only addresses part of a concern. I would argue for the most part environments are consequences of mostly passive choices that come together to affect stereotype threats. If we have an environment of all males and welcome females with open arms saying "everyone can code," are we sending that message through our hiring actions? If we have an environment that emphasizes late nights in the office, pounding energy drinks and team nights out at clubs and encourage anyone to join our team are we really being fair to those with families, are pregnant or want to build families? Those types of environments actually contribute to making selected classes not feel welcome and not feel capable.

      Stereotype threats are not simply addressed through positive statements. Any individual needs to feel actually valued and feel like the workspace they are in has a high standard of them and the workspace they create in their head has a high standard as well. It is not easy to help people overcome these challenges, but most of the most important obstacles we face are not easy to overcome. It is in the benefit of everyone involved that people do not feel like they are capable of less and therefore do less. I hope to overcome my own stereotype threats some how and I definitely hope to help individuals and the environments I am a part of avoid stereotype threats in the future.

  <h1>Unit 1, Week 3 Technical Blogpost</h1>
  <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
  <h4>Sunday January 11, 2015</h4>


  <section>
    <p>
      In this blogpost I am going to explore some of the differences between Arrays and Hashes. Both of these structures have their own strenghts and I am going to describe in very simple language scenarios where we would want to use one over the other in Ruby.   
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the easiest way to explain Hashes and Arrays in a nontechnical sense is to describe them as boxes for items. In programming we call these items elements. Take for example we have a box filled with hats. If the box is an array filled with hats this means the hats in the box are ordered by integer numbers; Integer numbers are like "...-2,-1,0,1,2..." If we would like the first hat in the box we ask for the hat with index 0. If we would like the last hat in the box we start from -1 and count the other way (-2,-3...) to the first hat. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now lets suppose we have a Hash filled with our hats. In our Hash of hats our hats are now categorized by some quality we define. In programming language this category is called a "key-value" or just "key." It is up to us what these key values are for our hats, we can say we have red hats, lucky hats, old hats or favorite hats. It is also up to us which hats in our Hash go under each key-value.One catch with our box is that any hat in our box must have some category in order to even get into our Hash box of hats. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrays and Hashes are similar structures and it might seem confusing which one we should use in our coding. I think the simplest way to describe which structure we should choose comes from how the elements are going to be stored. If we simply want to store elements in a box we should create an Array. If we need to store elements in a box that are associated with some characteristic, we should create a hash. This is a simple way to determine which one of these very similar structures will work best for what we are doing in our code.

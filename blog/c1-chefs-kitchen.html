      Welcome to my first cultural blogpost! Today I will share some of my first impressions of Dev Bootcamp after a week of our first phase of material.  
    </p>
    <p>
      My first impression of DBC is the amount of work available for us to do. Even at this very early stage there is a lot we learn about the process of developing software, even if I am not yet technically knowledgable enough to successfully develop things (YET!). I thought that I would not like the remote learning portion of the program, but I am finding it actually very enjoyable. The frequency of the office hours, the clarity of the instructions in our lessons and the activity in our online community makes the learning experience immersive, even remotely.

      The DBC culture in general seems to be dedicated to hard work and team work. I am really excited about being a part of this type of atmosphere. Part of my reason for joining DBC was not just learning how to develop software, but to learn it in the most challenging and immersive way possible. One of the DBC resources pre-enrollment talked about how we can learn even difficult skills in short amounts of time if we are taught the correct way and in the right atmosphere. In fact, sometimes a protracted learning schedule ends up teaching someone how to be a beginner, rather than how to be a self-starter or a functional level of a skill. I look forward to the short burst, immersive learning culture of DBC.

      Another key component of DBC is team work. I am also very excited about working on team projects as well. Part of my reason for joining the software development industry in general is wanting to work on teams. I have spent my time since graduating selling financial products and analyzing stocks for client portfolios. I conducted both of these activities on my own and have never really worked on a team on projects. I look forward to developing this skill because I know the best achievements come through a dedicated team working together.

      My expectations of DBC originally included a solid amount of work, but I did not really think about the work I would want to do on my own to learn new ideas or be better prepared for the onsite phases. I am definitely looking forward to the two weeks of break we have without new material as an opportunity to refine some of my html/css coding skills and introduce myself to some basic ruby skills.

      I am very excited to be a part of both our phase 0 and the upcoming experience in San Francisco. I look forward to the material and skills we are going to learn and the opportunity to learn in the DBC spacee. I might be too excited to be nervous, the main concern I have coming up is not the volume of learning and practice ahead of us, but figuring out my living situation in San Francisco!

  <h1>Classes vs IDs in HTML/CSS</h1>
  <h3>Best Practices</h3>

      For this week's blogpost on HTML/CSS I decided to write about a topic that confused me; how to choose between Classes vs IDs when defining a CSS selector. I found the existence of both selectors confusing because they appeared to accomplish the same goal. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp">CSS Selectors</a> allow you to apply CSS changes to HTML elements with variating specificity; on that site we can see examples of the syntax for both CSS selectors. Both IDs and Classes are empty by default, browsers will not populate any CSS attributes to a named ID or Class. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The ID selector is used for an individual, specific HTML element. Common IDs would be for the nav bar or the footer of a page. The nav bar might be an unordered list in its most basic HTML form, but it will likely get very different CSS treatment for usability.

      Here are a few best practices I thought of when determining how to use IDs and Classes:
        <ul>
          <li>Find</li>
          <li>Three</li>
          <li>Ideas</li>
        </ul>

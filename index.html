					<p id = "aboutmetext">
						I launched an investment advisory firm after graduating college in January 2011 and 
						generated portfolio returns in the top 1% of all money managers during the 3-year time 
						period ending December 2013. I took time off in Australia in 2014 and realized what I 
						was building did not fit in with my long-term happiness. It is difficult, and daunting,
						to commit to excellence in a new skill set and try to identify what I was looking for 
						in my next step. I realized a few crucial points that I wanted to focus on what I do 
						next, a team and speed. 
						<br><br>
						The teams we work with are one of the greatest sources of productivity and enjoyment in our
						daily lives. I will be the teammate possible in terms of reliability and support to the workplace 
						I join next. Joining a workplace dedicated to building and maintaining a great team is important 
						to me as someone seeking to produce and grow as a developer. One of the things I love 
						most about writing code is how a test of whether we our ideas are right can be done 
						immediately and conclusively. The rapid feedback we receive on our approach makes it possible 
						to build features that work quickly. Another key part of what I want to bring to a workplace
						is a commitment to speed as appropriately as possible.
